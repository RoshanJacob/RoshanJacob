- 👋 Hi, I’m @RoshanJacob
- 👀 I’m interested in coding different apps, especially if it is a game.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, after studying and experimenting with React Native.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this project - https://github.com/RoshanJacob/Advanced-Trex-Game-/tree/master
- 📫 How to reach me - currently not really there, maybe some time later.
